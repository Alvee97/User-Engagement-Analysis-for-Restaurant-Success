# User-Engagement-Analysis-for-Restaurant-Success
Have you ever wondered what makes some restaurants a hit while others struggle? This project dives into Yelp data to uncover what factors help restaurants thrive. By looking at things like reviews, tips, check-ins, and even the times people are most likely to engage, we are shedding some light on what drives success in the restaurant world.

About the Project
Using Yelp’s dataset, we are exploring how user engagement (reviews, tips, check-ins) ties into restaurant success metrics, like review counts and ratings. We look at trends over time, differences between highly rated and low-rated spots, and even how elite Yelp users impact restaurants.

Agenda
Problem Statement: It is tough to stand out in a competitive restaurant market, so we are looking into what factors can help restaurants succeed.
Goals:
Measure how reviews, check-ins, and tips affect ratings and popularity.
Check if positive feedback in reviews (like “useful,” “funny,” “cool”) helps boost a restaurant’s success.
Identify patterns over time and across locations.
The Data: Pulled from Yelp, this data covers restaurants in eight major cities across the United States and Canada.
Data Analysis and Findings
Engagement and Ratings: Generally, restaurants with more engagement tend to have better ratings, with a peak around 4 stars.
Interlinked Engagement: Reviews, tips, and check-ins are connected. A boost in one area can often lead to more activity in others.
Location, Location, Location: Some cities, like Philadelphia and Tampa, show higher success scores, suggesting they are great spots for the restaurant business.
Time Trends: High-rated restaurants usually keep consistent engagement, especially from November to March. Evening hours (4 pm to 1 am) are prime time for diners.
Sentiment Matters: Reviews tagged as “useful,” “funny,” or “cool” often indicate higher satisfaction and contribute to success.
Elite vs. Regular Users: Elite users make a big impact even though there are fewer of them. Building relationships with these users can boost repeat business.
Recommendations
Focus on All Forms of Engagement: The more active you are on different fronts, the more visibility you will get.
Team Up with Elite Users: Connect with Yelp’s elite users—they are more likely to leave detailed reviews and become loyal customers.
Optimise Your Hours: With engagement peaking in the evening, plan staffing and resources accordingly.
Consider Expanding in Key Cities: If you are planning to grow, cities with high engagement might be the best places to start.
Conclusion
By digging into this data, we have found some practical tips that can help restaurants get more out of Yelp. Whether it is boosting engagement, targeting specific hours, or building relationships with frequent reviewers, these insights could make a real difference.
