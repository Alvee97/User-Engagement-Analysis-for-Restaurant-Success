# User Engagement Analysis for Restaurant Success

## Introduction
<small>The primary aim of this project is to explore user engagement patterns on Yelp to understand what contributes to restaurant success. By analysing reviews, tips, check-ins, and other engagement factors, we provide insights that could help restaurants thrive in a competitive market. The dataset covers key metrics from restaurants in major cities across the United States and Canada.</small>

## Business Questions

After analysing the data, we focused on several key questions:

1. **How do reviews, tips, and check-ins impact a restaurant’s rating and popularity?**
2. **Is there a link between review feedback (like “useful,” “funny,” and “cool” tags) and overall restaurant success?**
3. **Which cities show the highest levels of engagement and success for restaurants?**
4. **What time trends are associated with high-performing restaurants?**
5. **How does engagement differ between elite Yelp users and regular users?**

## Data Analysis and Findings

Through extensive data analysis, we found:

- **Engagement and Ratings**: More engagement generally leads to better ratings, especially around the 4-star mark.
- **Interconnected Engagement**: Reviews, tips, and check-ins are closely linked, where an increase in one type of engagement often boosts others.
- **Location Insights**: Cities like **Philadelphia** and **Tampa** show higher success scores, suggesting they are prime locations for restaurant success.
- **Time-Based Patterns**: High-rated restaurants tend to have steady engagement throughout the year, particularly from **November to March**, with peak engagement hours in the evening.
- **Sentiment Effects**: Reviews tagged as “useful,” “funny,” or “cool” usually reflect higher satisfaction, positively impacting success.
- **Influence of Elite Users**: Elite users, though fewer, have a significant impact on restaurant visibility and customer loyalty.

## Recommendations

Based on the findings, here are some actionable recommendations:

- **Leverage All Engagement Channels**: Actively encourage reviews, tips, and check-ins to boost visibility and ratings.
- **Build Relationships with Elite Users**: Engaging with elite users can lead to valuable, detailed feedback and increased loyalty.
- **Optimise Business Hours**: Since evenings are peak times, ensure that resources and staffing are aligned with this trend.
- **Consider Expansion in High-Engagement Cities**: For growth, prioritise cities that show a high level of engagement and customer activity.

## Conclusion

This project provides practical insights into how user engagement can drive restaurant success on Yelp. By understanding and leveraging engagement trends, restaurant owners can make more informed decisions to attract and retain customers effectively.
